# HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

## Description

Our task was to refactor the website of Horiseon, a fictional SEO Services company, with the aim to make it more accessible for people using assistive technologies like screen readers and optimized for search engines.
To meet accessiblity standards I have completed the following:

- added Semantic HTML elements
- ordered HTML elements to follow a logical structure
- added Alt attributes to images and icons
- made sure Heading attributes fall in sequential order
- added a Title element that contains a concise, descriptive title
- added a Favicon, because i really like Favicons.
